					The Wild Animal Sanctuary currently operates two sites within Colorado totaling more than
					ten thousand acres.  We rescue animals from horrific captive situations and rehabilitate 
					them so they can live and roam freely within large natural habitats with others of their own kind.

				<p>
					A wildlife sanctuary, is a naturally occurring sanctuary, such as an island, that provides protection 
					for species from hunting, predation, competition or poaching; it is a protected area, a geographic 
					territory within which wildlife is protected. Refuges can preserve animals that are endangered.
					Such wildlife refuges are generally officially designated territories. They are created by government 
					legislation, publicly or privately owned (The area near the Chernobyl nuclear accident site accidentally
					became a wildlife refuge when it became uninhabitable to humans).
					In the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service applies the term "refuge" to various categories 
					of areas administered by the Secretary of the Interior for the conservation of fish and wildlife. The Refuge
					System includes areas administered for the protection and conservation of fish and wildlife that are threatened 
					with extinction, as well as wildlife ranges, game ranges, wildlife management areas, and waterfowl production areas. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Wildlife Sanctuaries are defined as a space which is set aside exclusively for the use of wild animals, 
					who are protected. Wildlife sanctuaries are also referred to as wildlife refuges in some areas. These 
					wildlife sanctuaries are managed by the Government where rangers or authorized employees patrol the area to
					ensure that no one hunts or otherwise harasses the animals.
					These wildlife sanctuaries are home to various endangered species of wild animals. It is a place where 
					these animals are safe from hunting, predation or competition. To protect these wild animals and their 
					habitat, Indian Government has established various wildlife sanctuaries and National Parks across the
					country. Some of these wildlife sanctuaries are popular and are known for their reserves around the globe.
				</p>
				<p>
					These wildlife sanctuaries and national parks have become happening tourist destination for wildlife 
					and nature lovers. Each year they attract millions of domestic as well as foreign tourists. The main 
					objective of establishing these wildlife sanctuaries is to safeguard various endangered species of India 
					from extinction in their natural habitat.These wildlife sanctuaries are dotted in various distinct regions 
					of the country. These sanctuaries are located in the majestic Himalayan peaks in the northern India to the 
					moist Nilgiri hills in the south. These wild life sanctuaries are the most sought after tourist destination
					for wildlife enthusiasts.
